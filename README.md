How does freq1 manipulate the freq of freq2?

    send the 2nd frequency to freq2

each user has a different random(freq)

the 2nd freq (delayed) gets sent through the socket

one namespace

1. alert to save the name
send the name to the server
2. create object JSON file w/ neDB
3. name and the mouseClicked data gets sent to the server(EMIT)
4. send this info back to the client
5. visual that contrasts the freq range


socket.userName = data.usrName
socket.score = socket.score + data.score
